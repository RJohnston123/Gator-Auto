# Gator Auto
Gator Auto is a student web/mobile application project built for an information systems class (CMPS 383) run by Envoc at Southeastern Louisiana University. The purpose of this project was to create a web and mobile app for an imaginary LA based car dealership "Gator Auto".

The web app's main purpose was to allow admins/workers to manage inventory and dealerships. It also has a vehicle search feature if customers wish to view vehicles the dealership has on the web.

The mobile app is purely for customers to view inventory, favorite vehicles and look up cars with a QR code. Our client stated that the dealership has QR codes on every car and if a customer scans the code with the app, they can pull up information about the vehicle.

This project was built with a React/React Native frontend and an ASP.Net backend. 
This was our first experience using these technologies.
